# Django Blog

## Basic blog site written in Django

This web application creates an very basic blog site using Django. The site allows blog authors to create text-only blogs using the Admin site, and any logged in user to add comments via a form. Any user can list all bloggers, all blogs, and detail for bloggers and blogs (including comments for each blog).
